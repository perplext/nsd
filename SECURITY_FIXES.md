# Security Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the security fixes applied to address gosec issues.

## 1. G304: File Inclusion via Variable (Path Traversal)

Fixed in the following files:
- `pkg/ui/theme.go`: Added `validateThemePath()` function to validate file paths before reading/writing theme files
- `pkg/ui/i18n/i18n.go`: Added `validateI18nPath()` function to validate translation file paths
- `pkg/recording/recorder.go`: Added `validateRecordingPath()` function to validate recording file paths
- `pkg/crypto/tls_decrypt.go`: Added `validateCryptoPath()` function to validate certificate and key file paths
- `pkg/security/config.go`: Already had path validation via `ValidateFilePath()`

Created a new security module:
- `pkg/security/pathvalidation.go`: Provides reusable safe file operations with path validation

## 2. G306: Insecure File Permissions

Changed file permissions from world-readable (0644) to owner-only (0600) in:
- `pkg/ui/theme.go`: ExportTheme() now uses 0600
- `pkg/ui/tui.go`: All file writes now use 0600
- `pkg/recording/recorder.go`: Directory creation now uses 0700
- `pkg/reassembly/file_extractor.go`: Directory creation uses 0700, file writes use 0600
- `pkg/recovery/recovery.go`: Checkpoint directory now uses 0700
- `cmd/i18n-scaffold/main.go`: Generated translation files now use 0600
- Test files also updated to use secure permissions

## 3. G114: HTTP Server without Timeouts

Fixed in:
- `pkg/api/server.go`: Replaced `http.ListenAndServe()` with properly configured `http.Server` with:
  - ReadTimeout: 15 seconds
  - WriteTimeout: 15 seconds
  - IdleTimeout: 60 seconds

## 4. G115: Integer Overflow

Added bounds checking and safe conversions in:
- `pkg/graph/graph.go`: All integer conversions from float64 now include:
  - Bounds checking before conversion
  - Validation that divisors are non-zero
  - Clamping values to valid ranges
  - Safe gradient index calculations

## 5. G404: Weak Random Number Generator

- Found in `pkg/graph/graph_bench_test.go`: Using math/rand in benchmark tests
- This is acceptable for benchmark/test code and does not need fixing

## Summary

All critical security issues have been addressed:
- Path traversal vulnerabilities are prevented with validation functions
- File permissions are now secure (0600/0700 instead of 0644/0755)
- HTTP server has proper timeout configuration
- Integer overflow issues have bounds checking
- Weak random in benchmarks is acceptable

The codebase should now pass gosec scans for these specific issues.
